    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello everyone my name is Anthony Zaniolo and I am a senior CIS major at IIT.  I enjoy playing sports, video games, and watching TV in my free time.  I don't have much free time anymore since I am working and going to school at the same time.  Below, I'll go into a bit more depth about my interests.  Hope you enjoy!</p>

      <h2 class="hobby-heading">Sports</h2>
      <ul class="hobby-ul">
        <li>When I was very young, I played baseball and played until I threw out my shoulder in high school.  I played a variety of positions but settled in later as a pitcher/catcher.  In high school, after I came back from my injury, I was the starting 2nd baseman of the varsity team.</li>
        <li>In around 4th or 5th grade, my mom said I was too fat and had to start playing a winter sport to get more exercise so I started playing basketball.  The reason I chose basketball was because in order to play hockey in my park district, you had to pass 3 figure skating classes and I only passed 2 of them.</li>
        <li>After starting high school, I decided to start playing soccer.  I ended up getting a spot as the backup goalkeeper since our current one was graduating that year.  After being the starter the next year and hating the position, I told my coach that I had carpel tunnel so I wouldn't have to play goalkeeper anymore</li>
        <li>After hurting my shoulder as a freshman, I decided to start playing tennis using my left hand.  It was really tough getting used to playing with my non-dominant hand, but I had so much fun playing I would practice all of the time.  I started out playing doubles and had a killer backhand (my baseball swing) and by the time I was a senior, I was playing first singles for the varsity team.</li>
        <li>During high school, I played a sport each season my first two years but as a junior, I dropped basketball because it was a lot of work and as a senior, I dropped soccer to focus on tennis.  Right now, I only play tennis since I can play with just one other person and it is some of the most fun I have playing sports.</li>

      <h2 class="hobby-heading">Video Games</h2>
      <p>Ever since I was a kid, I've loved video games.  One of my very first memories is from when I was 2 or 3 and I sat on my dads lap so I could use the keyboard and mouse to play Doom on the family PC.  Pretty much ever since then, I've always had some kind of controller in my hand starting with the SNES and Atari, then moving on to the gameboy color, so on and so forth.  Since I started in the early days of gaming and got exposed to the JRPG genre the most, it is still one of my favorite genres along with standard RPGs, FPS, and MMORPGs.  Nowadays, I play a lot of JRPGs and RPGs on the PS4 (The best system for RPG lovers), the switch is more for games I can play with my wife, and the PC is where I play competitive games.  If you ever need any help finding a game for yourself or somebody else, hit me up!</p>

      <h2 class="hobby-heading">TV</h2>
      <ul class="hobby-ul">
        <li>I love funny TV shows and generally like to laugh and joke with my friends.  My philosophy on TV is that if I want to be scared or sad, I could watch the news, so I tend to stay away from horror/non-fiction shows.  Here are some sitcoms I would recommend if you haven't seen them:</li>
        <li>
          <ul class="hobby-ul-indent">
            <li>The Office (UK and American are good!)</li>
            <li>Friends</li>
            <li>Parks and Recreation</li>
            <li>Brooklyn 99</li>
            <li>The Community</li>
            <li>Always Sunny in Philadelphia</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>A lot of these shows are finished already so perfect for bingewatching! Enjoy!</li>
