    <h1>Chestnut the Hedgehog</h1>
    <p>
      This is my (former) hedgehog Chestnut.  She unfortunately became really
      aggressive and needed to be returned to the breeder.  Despite that, she
      is still extremely cute and would love to share some information about
      her for anybody interested in hedgehogs.

    <h2>About Chestnut</h2>
    <p>
      Chestnut is an African Pygmy Hedgehog.
      I got her when she was about one and a half months old.
      She was about the size of a hamster when I got her (without the quills).
      Since her quills were almost always out she was probably around the size
      of a large apple.
      Hedgehogs are nocturnal animals so she normally would not wake up until I
      went to bed since the lights meant it was daytime to her.
      I had to return Chestnut to the breeder because she started biting my wife
      and I in order to get her way, which is abnormal for somewhat domesticated
      hedgehogs.

    <h2>Words of Warning...</h2>
    <h3>For anyone interested in owning a hedgehog after this here are some
      things to watch out for:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Hedgehogs need around an hour of your attention everyday or they will
        "desocialize".</li>
      <li>Like other small animals, they poo A TON.</li>
      <li>In nature they go to the bathroom while running which domestic
        hedgehogs like to emulate while on their wheel creating a poo tornado
        (It's as disgusting as it sounds).</li>
      <li>The first few months are extremely hard since they do not know you and
        you will get stuck with quills everyday.</li>
    </ul>
